For Thesis (the company)

My only concern in perfectly implementing this design was that the top nav bar had two menus shown - 
one with options laid out and one hamburger menu. Typically, a website will have a top nav bar that is 
expanded in a full-width browser. While the hamburger shows on small-width browsers, and 100% on mobile. 

I chose to go with this typical layout - expanded when large, hamburger when small. 

I hope this was the correct move!

- realized I had not added the TOS statement below the form. Oops! Tired hungry brain. Easy fix though,
just add a few things below the form: 

` <p> By clicking 'Sign Up' I agree to our* </p> <a href='#'> Terms of Service <a> `
  
  * I may change this verbage to 'your' rather than 'our'. Or change the 'I' to 'you'. Right now it's like the user
  is agreeding to their own TOS. 
  
- I made the colors green just to have my submission be a little more unique. I could easily change all greens
to blues though, simple as swapping the hsl values.
