For Thesis (the company)

My only concern in perfectly implementing this design was that the top nav bar had two menus shown - 
one with options laid out and one hamburger menu. Typically, a website will have a top nav bar that is 
expanded in a full-width browser. While the hamburger shows on small-width browsers, and 100% on mobile. 

I chose to go with this typical layout - expanded when large, hamburger when small. 

I hope this was the correct move!
